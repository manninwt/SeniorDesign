## Project Sought

During co-op, I spent more time developing process and business analysis sills than programming and most of my programming work involved working with back-end of web applications or creating modules for Microsoft Office. I have very limited experience with front-end development and complex algorithms. Therefore, I am looking for a capstone project that will help me improve in these two ares so that I will have a more rounded skill set for full time employment. I am less concerned with the subject of the project than I am with the skills that I will develop while working on the project.
