## Background Description
One of our group members has a parent who worked as a transportation supervisor for a shcool, and that parent noted that the current school's system lacked specific functionality.

## Problem Statement
The overall goal of the project is to create a bus route mapping system that would take different addresses provided as well as a number of accessable buses and create a route sytem that would encompass the provided area. The system would also allow for different updates and changes to be made, including adding and subtracting busses, adding and subtracting stops/students, and temporarily rerouting buses due to absent drivers/mechanical issues.

## Inadequacy of Current solutions
The current solution at the previosly mentioned school lacked the ability to handle rebuilding routes in real time and updating routes as new students were added.

## Backgrond skills/interests
The skills for this project will fit in closely with the course work we have encoutered throughout our collegate career. A focus on data structures for building out the different data types to represent the bus routes; an algorithm that weights the distance between points to find the fastest route as well as the shortest distance; a database to store all of the data; and the use of a GIS type system to convert geolocation data into useable points will all be required to create this application. 

## Project team approach
Build out a database, a data representation, an algorithm, and a front end to display data.
